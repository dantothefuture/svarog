ðŸ”¥ Svarog ðŸ”¥
=======

Svarog is a CLI that helps you protect your [Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore) schema from unwanted mutations. It generates a set of of helper functions based on [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org) files that you can use in your [Security Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started) to validate user input.

# Warning

This package **is not production-ready** by any means. Just look at the coverage, pal, you don't want that in your enterprise-level project with bright future.

# Usage

## ðŸšš Step 1 - install the package

```bash
$ npm i -g svarog
```

You can also install Svarog locally and run it either as `node_modules/.bin/svarog` in your terminal or using the short syntax in the `scripts` section of your `package.json`.

## ðŸ“ƒ Step 2 - describe your schema

Svarog was designed for [JSON Schema 7](https://json-schema.org/draft-07/json-schema-release-notes.html), but chances are that the earlier standards will be compatible with it as well. Here's an example `schema.json` file:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema",
  "$id": "Apple",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "color": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": [ "green", "red" ]
    }
  },
  "required": [ "color" ]
}
```

âš  **IMPORTANT:** one **valid** schema is expected per file. Support for references is coming soon. Some of the JSON Schema features are not supported.

## âš¡ Step 3 - run Svarog

Svarog is silent by default, and its only required argument is the path to the file containing your schema. You can also pass a [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) pattern to process multiple files at once.

```bash
$ svarog --verbose schema.json firestore.rules
```

The command above will write the following to the `firestore.rules` file in the current working directory:

```
// <svarog version="1.0.0">
function _s0(d,s){return ((d is map)&&(((d.color||s)&&(d.color is string))&&((d.color=="green")||(d.color=="red"))))}function _s(n,d,s){return ((n=="Apple")&&_s0(d,s))}function isValid(n){return _s(n,request.resource.data,(request.method=="create"))}
// </svarog>
```

That code snippet contains your schema validator and `isValid(schema: string): boolean` function that you can then use in your rules like this:

```
match /apples/{appleId} {
  allow write: if isValid("Apple");
}
```

Svarog will apply a *strict* schema check when a document is created (assuring that all required properties are present and nothing out of the schema is added), and a *loose* one on each update (when some properties defined in schema may be missing from the patch object).
