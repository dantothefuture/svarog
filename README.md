ðŸ”¥ Svarog ðŸ”¥
=======

Svarog is a CLI that helps you protect your [Firestore](https://cloud.google.com/firestore) schema from unwanted mutations. It generates a set of of helper functions based on [JSON Schema](https://json-schema.org) files that you can use in your [Security Rules](https://firebase.google.com/docs/firestore/security/get-started) to validate user input.

# Warning

This package **is not production-ready** by any means. Just look at the coverage, pal, you don't want that in your enterprise-level project with bright future.

# Usage

## ðŸšš Step 1 - install the package

```bash
$ npm i -g svarog
```

You can also install Svarog locally and run it either as `node_modules/.bin/svarog` in your terminal or using the short syntax in the `scripts` section of your `package.json`.

## ðŸ“ƒ Step 2 - describe your schema

Svarog was designed for [JSON Schema 7](https://json-schema.org/draft-07/json-schema-release-notes.html), but chances are that the earlier standards will be compatible with it as well. Here's an example `schema.json` file:

```json
{
  "$schema": "http://json-schema.org/draft-07/schema",
  "$id": "Apple",
  "type": "object",
  "properties": {
    "color": {
      "type": "string",
      "enum": [ "green", "red" ]
    }
  },
  "required": [ "color" ]
}
```

âš  **IMPORTANT:** one **valid** schema is expected per file. Support for references is coming soon. Some of the JSON Schema features are not supported.

## âš¡ Step 3 - run Svarog

Svarog is silent by default, and its only required argument is the path to the file containing your schema. You can also pass a [glob](https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob) pattern to process multiple files at once.

```bash
$ svarog --verbose schema.json firestore.rules
```

The command above will write the following to the `firestore.rules` file in the current working directory:

```
function isAppleValid(d) {
  return d.color && d.color is string && (d.color == 'green' || d.color == 'red');
}
```

You can then use this function in your Firestore Security Rules like this:

```
match /apples/{appleId} {
  allow create: if isAppleValid(request.resource.data);
}
```

# Reference
